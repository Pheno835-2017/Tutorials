<font color="#ff0000"><h3>
Adding another process
</h3></font>

Often, one wants to combine more than one process in the same event 
sample. For example, you can do combined top and bottom production:
<p>

<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  generate p p > t t~
<br>
  add process p p > b b~ 
</ul><font color="#000000">

Note that if you do another "generate", it will just overwrite the first 
generate. That's why you have to do "add process" instead.

<p>

Now you can output the resulting combined processes:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  output MY_SECOND_RUN
</ul><font color="#000000">
and launch:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  launch MY_SECOND_RUN
</ul><font color="#000000">
<p>
The resulting events generated will be correctly weighted according to 
their individual cross-sections.

This time we will only be interested in the cross-sections, and not
want to look at plots of kinematic variables. So we won't run Pythia, or 
either of the detector 
simulators. So when Madgraph asks what switches you want to turn on, 
you say
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  0
</ul><font color="#000000">
which means none. Madgraph will now give you the option of editing the 
parameter card, the run card, or the plot card. We'll just be looking at 
the total cross-section, so we just need a very quick run. So let's edit 
the run card to only ask for 1000 events. Type
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  2
</ul><font color="#000000">
and then change "10000" to "1000" on line 32. Save the file, and then
type 
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  0
</ul><font color="#000000">
to start the run.
<p>
When Madgraph is finished, you should see that the cross-section is 
something like 4.41e+08 pb, which is huge!  To see the individual 
contributions, you can type:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  open index.html
</ul><font color="#000000">
and click on "Results and Event Database". If you click on the 
cross-section number link, it will bring up a page that lists all of the 
individual partonic subprocesses, and how much they contributed. You can 
see that almost all of the cross-section is due to gluon+gluon > 
bottom+antibottom.
<p>

<font color="#ff0000"><h3>
Putting cuts at generator level
</h3></font>

<p>
Part of the reason the huge bottom+antibottom cross-section happened is 
because of very "soft" (low-pT) bottom
quarks, and from soft gluons splitting into bottom-antibottom pairs. 
In many cases, you will not be interested in such events anyway, and they 
will be cut out later at the analysis stage. To 
avoid them, go back to the Madgraph interactive terminal 
window and type 
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  launch MY_SECOND_RUN
</ul><font color="#000000">
again. Again, type:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  0
<br>
  2
</ul><font color="#000000">
But this time, we will further edit the run card. On line 106, you will 
see:
<br>
0 = ptb
<br>
which means that no cut is being imposed on the transverse momentum of the 
bottom or the antibottom. Change this to:
<br>
25 = ptb
<br>
so that we are imposing a generator-level cut that the transverse 
momentum of each bottom or antibottom parton has to be at least 25 
GeV.
Further down, you will see on line 132: 
<br>
  -1  = etab 
<br>
Change this to:
<br>
  5  = etab 
<br>
so that |eta| has to be at most 5, in other words not too close to the 
beampipe.
Finally, a little further down, on line 144, change:
<br>
0   = drbb
<br>
to
<br>
0.4   = drbb
<br>
to impose a cut that deltaR has to be at least 0.4 for the 
bottom-antibottom pair, so that they can be clearly 
distinguished in the detector. 
These cuts are somewhat redundant with each other, but give 
us a chance to 
see how to implement them. 
Now save and quit from the editor, and type
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  0
</ul><font color="#000000">
to start the run.
<p>
This time, you should see a cross-section of something like 1.34e+06 pb,
so more than a factor of 300 smaller. It is still dominated by 
the bottom-antibottom process, simply because the bottom quark is so mugh 
lighter than the top quark.

<p>
The cuts we have put in above are at "generator level". Their main purpose 
is to avoid having Madgraph waste time generating events that we are just 
going to cut later anyway. 
You can impose similar cuts on ordinary (non-b) jets,
leptons, and photons, by making similar edits in the run_card.dat.
Cuts can also be imposed after the events have 
passed through the detector simulator, which is how they would be imposed 
on real data.

<p>
<font color="#ff0000"><h3>
Multiparticles
</h3></font>
<p>

In principle, you can add as many processes as you want,
say like:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  generate p p > u u~
<br>
  add process p p > d d~ 
<br>
  add process p p > s s~ 
<br>
  add process p p > c c~ 
<br>
  add process p p > g g~ 
</ul><font color="#000000">
all of which would produce events with two jets. However, this can get 
tedious, so it is better to use multiparticles, a built-in Madgraph features.

<p>

You may have noticed that when you started up Madgraph, it said something 
like:
<p>
"Defined multiparticle p = g u c d s u~ c~ d~ s~
<br>
Defined multiparticle j = g u c d s u~ c~ d~ s~
<br>
Defined multiparticle l+ = e+ mu+
<br>
Defined multiparticle l- = e- mu-
<br>
Defined multiparticle vl = ve vm vt
<br>
Defined multiparticle vl~ = ve~ vm~ vt~
<br>
Defined multiparticle all = g u c d s u~ c~ d~ s~ a ve vm vt e- mu- ve~ 
vm~ vt~ e+ mu+ t b t~ b~ z w+ h w- ta- ta+"
<p>
The multiparticle "p" is the proton, which we've already used.
The jet multiparticle "j" means to sum over all of the same gluon, quark, 
and antiquark partons, but in the final state.
The multiparticle "l-" means to sum over electrons and muons, and the
multiparticle "l+" means to sum over their antiparticles.
The multiparticles "vl" and "vl~" are for all neutrinos and 
anti-neutrinos.

You can also define your own multiparticles for convenience, for example:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  define k = g u u~ c c~ d d~ s s~ b b~
</ul><font color="#000000">
would define a multiparticle similar to j, but that also includes bottom and 
antibottom. 

<p>

So you can do things like:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  generate p p > j j
</ul><font color="#000000">
which will generate the same thing as the previous combination.
You can also generate all 3-jets events, like this:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  generate p p > j j j
</ul><font color="#000000">
etc. When you get up to 4 or 5 or more jets, Madgraph can take a 
very long 
time 
to run.

<p>
<font color="#ff0000"><h3>
Jet matching
</h3></font>
<p>

However, there is a tricky point here. If you do this:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  generate p p > j j 
<br>
  add process p p > j j j
</ul><font color="#000000">
you will actually be double-counting events. This is because when Pythia 
does the parton shower and hadronization of the 2-jet final state, it will 
automatically produce some additional jets, which would be 
partially redundant with the 3-jet events. To avoid this is an advanced 
topic; you need to "match" the two samples. If you need to become an 
expert on this, start at these links:
<br>
<a href="https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/IntroMatching">
https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/IntroMatching
</a>
<br>
<a href="https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/Matching">
https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/Matching
</a>
<p>

The same issue arises, for example, in top quark production. This is fine:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  generate p p > t t~ j
</ul><font color="#000000">
(usually with a cut on the pT of the extra jet, imposed in the 
run_card.dat 
file) but doing this:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  generate p p > t t~ 
<br>
  add process p p > t t~ j
</ul><font color="#000000">
requires that you understand the jet matching procedure to avoid 
double-counting.
<p>


<p>
<font color="#ff0000"><h3>
How to put restrictions on decays
</h3></font>
<p>

Sometimes you might be interested in only a subset of events with special 
properties, like events that have leptons in them. Here's an example. 
Suppose you want to produce a W boson at the LHC. The command 
would be:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  generate p p > W+ 
</ul><font color="#000000">
But perhaps you only care about the subset of events 
where the W boson decays to an antimuon and a muon neutrino. 
The command would be:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  generate p p > W+, W+ > mu+ vm
</ul><font color="#000000">
This tells Madgraph that it should only produce, and only calculate the 
cross-section for, events in which the W decays to a muon. 
You can also use multiparticles with this syntax (but only for the final 
particle in the decay, not the decaying particles). So, for example,
you could generate events where a W is produced with a jet, and then the 
jet decays to a lepton:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
  generate p p > W+ j, W+ > l+ vl
</ul><font color="#000000">
This sort of thing is useful because the decays to 
jets have huge backgrounds compared to the decays to leptons. You don't 
want to have Madgraph 
waste time producing a bunch of events that you are just 
going to ignore 
anyway. 

<p>

Here's a more complicated example involving a decay chain:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
generate p p > t t~, (t > W+ b, W+ > j j), (t~ > W- b~, W- > l- vl~)
</ul><font color="#000000">
This tells Madgraph to produce a top+antitop pair, but only keep events 
where the top decays to 
a W and a bottom (which it almost always does anyway), and where the 
antitop decays to a W and a bottom  with the W decaying leptonically.

<p>

We'll do another example later when we discuss the Higgs decay to two photons.
In general, the restrictions on decays are most useful when the decays 
involved are both important to the signal you are trying 
to observe and relatively rare.

<p>
<font color="#ff0000"><h3>
How to require the presence or absence of particles in Feynman diagrams
</h3></font>
<p>

Sometimes you might want to exclude Feynman diagrams that contain 
a particular particle. For example, suppose you wanted to generate
a sample of electron + positron production, but you wanted to 
exclude any Feynman diagrams that contain a Z boson. You could do this by:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
generate p p > e+ e- / Z
</ul><font color="#000000">
The "/ Z" means to exclude a Feynman diagram if it has a 
Z boson in it.

You can also exclude a particle from appearing in the s-channel, by
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
generate p p > e+ e- $ Z                                          
</ul><font color="#000000">

Finally, you can include only those Feynman diagrams in which a 
certain particle 
is present in the s-channel, 
for example by
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
generate p p > Z > e+ e-                                          
</ul><font color="#000000">

Each of these should be used with care, because they can result in 
violating gauge invariance or unitarity if you aren't careful.

Beware of Madgraph 4 syntax; it often doesn't work in Madgraph 5.


<p>
<font color="#ff0000"><h3>
Importing new models
</h3></font>
<p>
One of the main uses of Madgraph is to study hypothetical particles that 
can exist in theories like supersymmetry, which is an extension of the 
Standard Model. It has a bunch of new particles, with new interactions.
To include them, you need to import the information about the model into 
Madgraph. Madgraph comes with several different versions of supersymmetry,
including mssm (the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model). If you want to
do something with supersymmetry, first make your own copy of the model
directory that contains all of the particle mass and coupling information.
Before starting Madgraph, you would do this:

<ul><font color="#0000ff">
cd /xdata/$USER/madgraph/models                                           
<br>
cp -rfvp mssm mssm_$USER
<br>
cd /xdata/$USER/madgraph                                           
</ul><font color="#000000">

<p>

Now when you start Madgraph, you can do:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
import model mssm_$USER
</ul><font color="#000000">
This replaces the default model ("sm", the Standard Model).

<p>

In supersymmetry, there is a particle called the gluino, with symbol "go".
So, for example, to simulate the production of a pair of gluinos, you would do:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
generate p p > go go
</ul><font color="#000000">
There are a lot of other particles in the mssm too. To use this model, you 
would want to be able to change the masses of the supersymmetric 
particles. (The default for the gluino mass, for example, is set at 607 
GeV, which is ruled out now.) Unfortunately, at the moment this seems to 
require registration at the Madgraph web site to use a tool they have 
online for producing a parameter_card.dat for this model. You can also
modify the default parameter_card.dat file by hand, but this is tricky and 
dangerous.

<p>

<font color="#ff0000"><h3>
Choosing your plots
</h3></font>
<p>

By default, Madgraph produces a lot of plots that may not be very 
interesting. Conversely, it may not produce some plots that you might 
want, or it might produce them with axes that don't have the appropriate 
scale, or histogram bin sizes that are too large or too small. You can 
modify the plot_card.dat to customize the plots.
Here's an example.

<p>

Let's do muon + antimuon production at the LHC. We would start with:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
generate p p > mu+ mu-
<br>
output MUON_PROD
<br>
launch MUON_PROD
</ul><font color="#000000">
We will want to see the plots of the invariant mass of the mu+ mu- pair
first at parton level, and then from Delphes at detector level.
So we select switches according to:
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
1
<br>
3
<br>
0
</ul><font color="#000000">
Now select
<ul><font color="#0000ff">
9
</ul><font color="#000000">
to edit the plot card. This will allow us to choose what plots we want.
There are some instructions inside the file. 
In this case, we want to add a new 
"class" of particles for the muons. After line 83, insert a new line:
<p>
mu 13 -13                #Class number 3
<p>
Here, 13 and -13 are the Particle Data Group codes for a muon and antimuon
respectively.
<p>
Now, starting on line 128 is the list of plots that Madgraph will produce.
In this example, we don't care about any of them; we only want to make a 
plot of the invariant mass of the muon+antimuon pair. So, delete all of
the lines between "Begin PlotDefs" and "End PlotDefs". In their place, put 
just one line that reads
<p>
mij 3 2
<p>
This tells Madgraph that we want to plot the invariant masses of all pairs
in class 3 (muons), up to the first 2 (ordered by pT). 
<p>
Finally, you will see lines sandwiched between "Begin PlotRange" and 
"End PlotRange". Change the mij entry to read
<p>
mij       4   0  200
<p>
This means that we want histogram bins that are 4 GeV wide, and we want 
the axis to go from 0 to 200 GeV.
Now, save the file and exit, and start the run. When done, inspect the 
invariant mass plot. You should be able to pick out the Z boson mass peak.
Here's what it looks like at parton level (Madevent output):
